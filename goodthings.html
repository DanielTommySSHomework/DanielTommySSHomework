            <h2>Our Big Question: Is the silk a story of peaceful trade, and a rich history of religious and harmonious
                cultural exchange? </h2>
            <p>The Silk Road is a peaceful trade, and a rich history of religious and harmonious cultural exchange for
                <br>
                several reasons. First of all, it helped to generate trade and commerce between a number of different
                <br>
                kingdoms and empires. As the Silk Road grew, more people started working on the Silk Road and started
                <br>
                making money. The Silk Road also helped the spread of religions. Before the Silk Road, Buddhism was 
                <br>
                about to die out. However, the Silk Road helped to spread Buddhism, so it saved the religion from dying
                <br>
                out.
