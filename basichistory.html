            <h2>Our Big Question: Is the Silk Road was a story of peaceful trade, and a rich history of religious and
                harmonious cultural exchange? </h2>
            <p>
                Some people who don’t know about the Silk Road would get tricked by its name. First of all, it wasn’t a
                <br>
                road that made of silk. Secondly, it wasn’t only a road; some parts of the Silk Road were actually
                <br>
                ocean-based. Furthermore, silk was not the only item to be traded along the Silk Road. And lastly,
                <br>
                there was not just one road but many roads that comprised the Silk road. There were many of them.
                <br>
                The Silk Road is not just a road but a “road” of globalization. It connected Asia first, and then Asia
                <br>
                connected to Europe. It connected to parts of Africa at the end. The Silk Road started in Chang’an in
                <br>
                130 B.C. It worked by trading between countries.
