            <h2>Our Big Question: Is The Silk Road was a story of peaceful trade, and a rich history of religious and
                harmonious cultural exchange? </h2>
            <p>
                Over all, we slightly disagree that The Silk Road was a story of peaceful trade, and a rich history of
                <br>
                religious and harmonious cultural exchange. The positive opinions are not as strong enough as the the
                <br>
                negative opinions. During the time that the Silk Road was positive, there were still some bad things
                <br>
                happening for example, the thieves.
